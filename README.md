# LuaCXX

This is a C++ library that makes it easier to use Lua by providing an intuitive abstraction over the Lua state. Allowing you to easily put it into any existing project that integrates Lua.

**This library is still very much in the works, it lacks access to many Lua's most useful features.**

## Does it work on version *?
